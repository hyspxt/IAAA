# Description
This repo contains files for "Introduzione all'Apprendimento Automatico" project - 93319 course (aka Machine Learning), Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, UniBo. 
In this case, our task was to create, train, and test a neural network (NN) model to solve an impainting problem on some instances of randomly masked satellite imagery. 
The model was to be developed entirely in 'Keras/Tensorflow' as a costraints.
Given the nature of the problem, we opted for a convolutional type network, specifically following an encoder-decoder structure. More info in .iypnb notebooks.


## Dependencies
Aside from Keras, there is an extensive list of necessary imports in the first code cell in PatrickAlfieri.iypnb. 

## Building, Running and Testing
You can simply run each cell code with ease in Google Colab in cloud or on you're machine with Jupyter Notebook, and that's it.
